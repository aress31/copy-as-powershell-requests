## Copy as PowerShell request(s) plugin for Burp Suite

Standard or Base64 formats are available, with Base64 being the best option for binary data such as file uploads. Copied data also includes the necessary command to [invoke the web request(s)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-webrequest?view=powershell-5.1).</p>
